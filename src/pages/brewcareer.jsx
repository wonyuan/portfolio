        <h3>overview</h3>
        <p><i>
            36 hours, 1 ux designer, 3 product designers
        </i></p>
        <p>my roles for this project were <b>ui/ux designer, branding, prototyping and user testing.</b></p>
        <p>our team was awarded <b>2nd best overall.</b></p>
        
        <h3> problem </h3>
        <p style={{marginBottom:'35px'}}>
        submitted as a part of the uwaterloo's first designathon ctrl + y, the presented problem
        required us to find an empowering solution for job seekers and independent workers
        looking to find projects, networks, and ways to navigate the current job market.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        as a result of there being a diverse number of pre-existing solutions in the market, (ex.
        ripple, linkedin, indeed...) we put an extra emphasis on narrowing down a more specific
        problem within the industry, <b>being meaningful networking</b>.
        </p>
        <h3> solution</h3>
        <p>
        after planning for (nearly) half a day, we were able to decide on the three main features of
        a web-application that would cover a wide range of uses.
        <ol>
        <li>a speed-dating esque, matching system for professionals </li>
        <li>interest & co-work specific group forums</li>
        <li>community-initiated projects for growing professionals</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <div class="proj-img-container">
          <img src="/brew2.png" alt="Project Image" class="proj-img"></img>
          <span class="hover-text">preliminary brainstorming and planning</span>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <p>utilizing user personas, we finally had a vision of the ui for our project, ensuring 
        accessibility as well as aesthetics. some of the key ideas we were able to piece out were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>what are some blockers that prevent one from networking?</li>
          <li>what do you wish was more convenient in the job-hunt process?</li>
          <li>when have you been able to create a long-lasting connection?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="proj-img-container">
          <img src="/brew3.png" alt="brew3 img" class="proj-img"></img>
          <span class="hover-text">sarah, a recently laid off <br/>professional looking for work</span>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <h3>user flow</h3>
        <div class="proj-img-container">
          <img src="/brew5.png" alt="brew3 img" class="proj-img"></img>
          <span class="hover-text">flow analysis of the initial prototype</span>
        </div>
        <h3>delivery</h3>
          <p>
          after demoing our final product to the judges, we were able to win 2nd place overall out of the 20
          competing groups at the designathon! being my first designathon, i got to really put my mind to the
          entire design process––from the initial ideation to the final prototyping, and all in 36 hours!
